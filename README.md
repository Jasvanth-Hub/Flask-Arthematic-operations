# Flask Arithmetic Operations Web App

Welcome to the Flask Arithmetic Operations Web App! This project was developed as part of my training in full-stack web development using Flask and Python. It's a simple web application that performs arithmetic operations based on user input.

## Features

- **Arithmetic Operations**: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **User Input Forms**: Input numbers and select the operation through forms.
- **Back-end Calculation**: The arithmetic operations are performed on the server-side using Python and Flask.
- **Error Handling**: Handle invalid inputs and division by zero errors gracefully.
